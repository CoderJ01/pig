# Pig

## Purpose
This website is designed merely to contain the link for my Pig project in a presentable fashion; that's it. The user interface is simple, neat, and clean. When the user clicks on the link, a zip folder is downloaded onto the user's computer. The zip file, Pig.zip, contains three items - the codebase (.txt), writeup (.docx), and flowchart (.docx) for Pig. The code for Pig is designed to mimick the dice game called Pig. The rules for Pig are explained [here](https://github.com/CoderJ01/pig/blob/main/assets/plain_text/write-up.txt).
